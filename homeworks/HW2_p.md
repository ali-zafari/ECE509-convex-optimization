1. Let f : $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function with $\mathrm{dom}$ f being closed. Prove that the function is closed. (5 points) 
    
    [Hint: In order to show the closedness of any arbitrary sublevel set, start with any convergent sequence in the sublevel set, and argue using the closedness of the domain as well as the continuity of the function that the limit point of the sequence must be in the sublevel set. Talk to me after class or come to office hours if not sure about this hint.]

2. Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function with $\mathrm{dom} f$ being open. Prove that the function is closed if and only if for every sequence $x_i \in \mathrm{dom}f$ such that $\lim_i x_i = x \in \mathrm{bd}\,\mathrm{dom} f$, we have $\lim_{i \to \infty} f(x_i) = \infty$.

    [Hints: In order to prove the "if" part, use an approach similar to problem 1 above, except that you would have to argue using the given assumption that the limit point for any arbitrary sublevel set cannot be on the boundary of the domain. In order to prove the "only if" part, argue that there must exist a sublevel set that is equal to the domain of the function, which is open by construction. Talk to me after class or come to office hours if not sure about these hints.]
